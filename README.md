Data Sets: Forbes Top 2000 List of Companies for 2015 and 2020

Project Proposal:
We will join the datasets on the “Company Name” column. If the companies aren’t in both sets, then we will drop the record. We will load this into a relational database. 

Creating the Project:
We opened Forbes 2015 and 2020 top ranked companies to combine the files. We started in Panda's to read and upload the CSV into Pandas. We cleaned up the unnecessary columns within the two files. We then extracted the CSV's to upload into PGAdmin. In PG Admin we created the tables, experienced some issues and successfully debugged the issue. We we were able to create the two databases and then join them into one. We then extracted the newly created database and loaded the relational database into Panda's to be ready for data analysis should someone be interested in the statistics.
